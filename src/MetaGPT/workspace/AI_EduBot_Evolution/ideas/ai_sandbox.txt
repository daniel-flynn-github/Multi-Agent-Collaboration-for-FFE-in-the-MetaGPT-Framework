Idea: AI Sandbox
Idea Description: The AI Sandbox is a feature that allows students to experiment with AI in a safe and controlled environment. It provides a virtual playground where students can test their AI algorithms and see the results in real-time. The AI Sandbox uses a physics engine to simulate the robot's movements and interactions with the environment. This feature would be integrated into the robot's programming interface, allowing students to switch between coding and testing modes easily. This feature addresses the pain point of 'Difficulty in preparing practical AI sessions'.
