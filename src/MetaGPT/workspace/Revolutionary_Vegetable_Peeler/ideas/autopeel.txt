Idea: AutoPeel
Idea Description: AutoPeel is a hands-free vegetable peeler designed to address the time-consuming nature of peeling. The device would use a small, rechargeable electric motor to rotate the vegetable while a stationary blade peels the skin off. The user would simply need to insert the vegetable into the device and press a button to start the peeling process. The peeler would be equipped with sensors to adjust the peeling pressure according to the vegetable's size and hardness, ensuring efficient peeling without waste. The device would be made from durable, easy-to-clean materials and feature a safety lock to prevent accidental activation.
