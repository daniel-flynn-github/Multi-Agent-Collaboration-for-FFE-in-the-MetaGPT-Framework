Idea: PeelClean
Idea Description: PeelClean is a vegetable peeler with an integrated waste collection compartment. This feature would address the mess created during the peeling process by collecting the peels in a detachable compartment for easy disposal. The peeler would be designed with a sharp, stainless steel blade for efficient peeling and a comfortable, non-slip handle for ease of use. The peeler and the waste compartment would be dishwasher-safe for easy cleaning. The peeler would also have a safety cover for the blade to prevent accidents when not in use.
