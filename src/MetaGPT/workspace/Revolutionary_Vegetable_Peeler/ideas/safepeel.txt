Idea: SafePeel
Idea Description: SafePeel is a vegetable peeler designed with safety in mind. The peeler would feature a protective finger guard that prevents the user's fingers from coming into contact with the blade. The blade itself would be made from high-quality stainless steel for durability and sharpness, and the handle would be ergonomically designed for a secure grip. The peeler would also have a locking mechanism that covers the blade when not in use, preventing accidental cuts. The device would be easy to clean and made from recyclable materials, aligning with the company's sustainability goals.
