Emma spends her morning in the garden, picking fresh vegetables. She then peels them for a soup she's making for her grandchildren. The peeler is hard to handle and she fears she might cut herself. In the evening, she prepares dinner, again using the peeler. It's tiring for her hands and she struggles to clean it afterwards.
