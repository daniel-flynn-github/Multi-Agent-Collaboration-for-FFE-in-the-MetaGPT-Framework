Journey Map: 
Sophie starts her day with a vegan smoothie, peeling fruits for it. She then goes to her classes and part-time job. In the evening, she cooks a vegan meal for her friends, peeling various vegetables. The peeler is not very efficient and it's hard for her to clean it afterwards. Despite the challenges, she enjoys sharing her vegan lifestyle with her friends.
