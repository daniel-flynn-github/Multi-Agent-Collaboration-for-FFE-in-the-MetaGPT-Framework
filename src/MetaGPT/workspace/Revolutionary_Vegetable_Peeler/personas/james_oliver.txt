Journey Map: 
James starts his day with a healthy smoothie, peeling apples and cucumbers for it. He then works on his freelance projects. During lunch, he prepares a salad, peeling carrots and cucumbers. The peeler is not very efficient and takes time. In the evening, he tries a new recipe that requires peeled vegetables. He struggles with the peeler and it takes longer than expected.
