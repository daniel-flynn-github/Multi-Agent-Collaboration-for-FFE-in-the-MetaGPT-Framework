Idea: AI Concept Demonstrations
Idea Description: To address the pain point of complexity in explaining AI concepts, we can develop a range of AI concept demonstrations that can be performed by the robot. These would provide practical demonstrations of theoretical concepts, helping to enhance understanding. The demonstrations would be pre-programmed into the robot's software, allowing teachers to easily select and run the desired demonstration. This would be achieved by developing a range of demonstration scripts that can be loaded onto the robot. The scripts would control the robot's movements and actions, providing a visual and interactive demonstration of the AI concept.
