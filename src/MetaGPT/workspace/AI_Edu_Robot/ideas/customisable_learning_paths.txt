Idea: Customisable Learning Paths
Idea Description: Another way to simplify the explanation of AI concepts is to develop customisable learning paths. These would allow teachers to tailor the robot's activities to the specific learning needs and interests of their students. The learning paths would be created through a user-friendly software interface, allowing teachers to select and sequence activities and demonstrations. This would be achieved by developing a learning path creation tool within the robot's software. The tool would provide a range of activities and demonstrations to choose from, allowing teachers to create a unique and engaging learning experience for their students.
