Idea: Pre-Programmed Lesson Modules
Idea Description: To address the pain point of time-consuming lesson planning, we can develop a range of pre-programmed lesson modules that can be easily loaded onto the robot. These modules would cover a variety of AI and machine learning concepts, providing hands-on activities for students. The modules would be designed to be engaging and interactive, encouraging active learning. The modules could be updated and expanded over time, ensuring the product remains relevant. This would be achieved by developing a simple user interface for the robot's software, allowing teachers to easily select and load the desired module. The modules would be stored on a cloud-based platform, allowing for easy updates and additions.
