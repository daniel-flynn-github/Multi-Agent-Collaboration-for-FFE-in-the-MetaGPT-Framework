Idea: Interactive AI Tutor
Idea Description: Another way to reduce the time spent on lesson planning is to develop an interactive AI tutor feature. This would be a voice-activated assistant that can guide students through various AI and machine learning concepts. The tutor would be programmed with a range of responses and explanations, allowing it to answer student questions and provide guidance. This would be achieved by integrating a voice recognition system into the robot's software. The tutor could also provide real-time feedback on student performance, helping to enhance understanding and engagement.
