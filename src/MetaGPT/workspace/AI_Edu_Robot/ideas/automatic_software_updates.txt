Idea: Automatic Software Updates
Idea Description: To address the pain point of difficulty in updating the robot's software, we can develop an automatic update feature. This would ensure the robot's software is always up-to-date with the latest features and improvements. The updates would be downloaded and installed automatically when the robot is connected to the internet. This would be achieved by integrating an update management system into the robot's software. The system would regularly check for updates and install them without requiring user intervention. This would ensure the product remains relevant and effective, without placing additional demands on teachers.
