Back home, Alex sets up his kitchen for cooking, arranging his tools and appliances. He experiments with new recipes, chopping, mixing, and tasting along the way. As guests arrive, Alex puts finishing touches on the dishes and serves them with pride. After the party, he cleans up the kitchen and reflects on the successful evening.
