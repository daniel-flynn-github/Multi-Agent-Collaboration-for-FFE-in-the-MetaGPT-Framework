Journey Map: 
Sophia wakes up early on a Saturday morning, excited for her hiking trip. She packs her walking backpack with essentials like water, snacks, a map, and a first aid kit. She drives to the trailhead and starts her hike, enjoying the fresh air and scenic views. Along the way, she stops to take photos and rest. After a few hours, she reaches the summit and takes in the breathtaking panorama. She unpacks her lunch from the backpack and relaxes before heading back down the trail.
