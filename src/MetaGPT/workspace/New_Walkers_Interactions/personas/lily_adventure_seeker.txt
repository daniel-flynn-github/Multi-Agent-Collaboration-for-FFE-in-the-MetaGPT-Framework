Journey Map: 
Lily plans a nature walk with her children in the nearby forest. She packs snacks, water bottles, sunscreen, bug spray, and a small first aid kit in the walking backpack. Her kids carry their own mini backpacks with toys and binoculars. Lily adjusts the backpack straps for comfort and sets off on the trail with her enthusiastic children. Along the way, they spot wildlife, play nature games, and have a picnic by a stream. The versatile backpack makes it easy for Lily to manage her kids and enjoy the outdoor experience.
