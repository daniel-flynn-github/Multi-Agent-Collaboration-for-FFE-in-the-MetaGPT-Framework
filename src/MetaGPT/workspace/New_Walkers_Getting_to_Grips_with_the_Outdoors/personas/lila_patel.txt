Journey Map: 
Inspired by a new project, Lila sets out for a creative hiking expedition. She packs her walking backpack with a sketchbook, colored pencils, and a portable easel. As she explores picturesque landscapes, she adjusts the backpack for easy access to her art supplies. Lila captures the beauty of nature through sketches and watercolor paintings, immersing herself in the creative process. She takes breaks to savor the sights and sounds around her. After a day of artistic exploration, she returns home with a collection of nature-inspired artworks and a refreshed perspective.
