Journey Map: 
On a Sunday morning, Alex prepares for a day of hiking to unwind from his tech-filled week. He carefully organizes his walking backpack with water, trail mix, and a map. As he navigates the trail, he adjusts the backpack for weight distribution and comfort. Alex encounters steep inclines and uneven terrain, pushing his physical limits. He takes moments to appreciate the silence of nature and disconnect from screens. After a rewarding hike, he heads home feeling refreshed and accomplished.
