Idea: AI Curriculum Integrator
Idea Description: Another solution to the 'Limited time for planning next day' pain point is the AI Curriculum Integrator. This feature will use AI algorithms to map the robot's capabilities to the specific learning objectives and curriculum requirements. This will help teachers integrate the robot into their existing lesson plans, reducing the time spent on planning and preparation. The integrator will also provide suggestions for activities that the robot can perform, helping teachers maximise the educational value of the robot. The integrator will be accessible via a web-based interface, allowing teachers to integrate the robot into their curriculum from any device with internet access.
