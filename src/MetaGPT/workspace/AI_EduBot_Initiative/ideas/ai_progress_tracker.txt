Idea: AI Progress Tracker
Idea Description: Another solution to the 'Limited time for providing feedback' pain point is the AI Progress Tracker. This feature will track student progress over time, providing a visual representation of their learning journey. The tracker will use AI algorithms to analyse student performance data, identifying trends and patterns. This will provide valuable insights for teachers, helping them tailor their teaching strategies to meet the individual needs of their students. The tracker will be accessible via a web-based interface, allowing teachers to monitor student progress from any device with internet access.
