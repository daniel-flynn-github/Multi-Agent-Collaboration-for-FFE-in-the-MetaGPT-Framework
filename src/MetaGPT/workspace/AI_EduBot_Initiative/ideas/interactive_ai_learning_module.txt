Idea: Interactive AI Learning Module
Idea Description: To address the pain point of 'Limited time for project work', we propose an Interactive AI Learning Module. This module will be a pre-programmed set of activities that students can engage with at their own pace. It will include a series of tasks that the robot can perform, demonstrating various AI concepts. The module can be easily integrated into existing lesson plans, requiring minimal preparation time from teachers. The module will be designed to be engaging and fun, promoting student enthusiasm and motivation for learning. The module will be programmed using a simple, user-friendly interface, allowing teachers to easily modify the tasks to suit their specific teaching needs.
