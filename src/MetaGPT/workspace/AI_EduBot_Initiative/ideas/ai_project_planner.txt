Idea: AI Project Planner
Idea Description: Another solution to the 'Limited time for project work' pain point is the AI Project Planner. This feature will allow teachers to plan and schedule projects in advance, with the ability to set specific tasks for the robot to perform at designated times. This will help teachers manage their time more effectively, reducing the time spent on planning and preparation. The planner will be accessible via a web-based interface, allowing teachers to plan their projects from any device with internet access. The planner will also include a library of pre-programmed tasks that teachers can use as a starting point for their projects.
