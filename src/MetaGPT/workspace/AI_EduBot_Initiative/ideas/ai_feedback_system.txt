Idea: AI Feedback System
Idea Description: To address the 'Limited time for providing feedback' pain point, we propose an AI Feedback System. This system will use AI algorithms to automatically evaluate student performance based on their interaction with the robot. The system will provide real-time feedback to students, helping them understand their strengths and areas for improvement. The feedback will be presented in a clear, easy-to-understand format, making it easy for teachers to review and discuss with students. The system will also include a feature for teachers to add their own feedback, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of student performance.
