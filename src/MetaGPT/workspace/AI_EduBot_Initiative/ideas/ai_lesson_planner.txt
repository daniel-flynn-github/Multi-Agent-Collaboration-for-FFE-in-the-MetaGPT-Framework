Idea: AI Lesson Planner
Idea Description: To address the 'Limited time for planning next day' pain point, we propose an AI Lesson Planner. This feature will use AI algorithms to generate lesson plans based on the specific learning objectives and curriculum requirements. The planner will include a library of pre-programmed activities that the robot can perform, providing a hands-on learning experience for students. The planner will also include a feature for teachers to customise the lesson plans, allowing them to incorporate their own teaching methods and strategies. The planner will be accessible via a web-based interface, allowing teachers to plan their lessons from any device with internet access.
