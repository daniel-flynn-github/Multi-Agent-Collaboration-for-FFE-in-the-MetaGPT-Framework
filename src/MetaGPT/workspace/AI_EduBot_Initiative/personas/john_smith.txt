Journey Map: 
John starts his day by reviewing his lesson plan for the day. He incorporates the AI educational robot into his lesson plan, allowing students to experiment with it during class. They use the robot to understand basic AI concepts, programming it to perform simple tasks. During lunch, John discusses the robot's capabilities with fellow teachers. In the afternoon, he assigns a project where students have to program the robot to solve a complex problem. After school, he spends time reviewing the robot's performance and planning for the next day.
