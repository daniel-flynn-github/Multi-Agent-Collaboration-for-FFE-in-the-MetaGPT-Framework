Journey Map: 
Sarah starts her day by preparing for her lecture. She uses the AI educational robot as a teaching tool, demonstrating advanced AI concepts. During her lecture, she allows students to interact with the robot, programming it to perform complex tasks. After the lecture, she assigns a project where students have to use the robot to solve a real-world problem. In the evening, she reviews the students' projects and provides feedback.
