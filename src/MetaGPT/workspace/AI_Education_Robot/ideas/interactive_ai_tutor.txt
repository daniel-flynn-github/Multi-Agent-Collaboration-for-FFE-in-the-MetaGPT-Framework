Idea: Interactive AI Tutor
Idea Description: To address the pain point of difficulty in addressing all student queries, an Interactive AI Tutor can be developed. This feature would use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand student queries and provide appropriate responses. The AI Tutor can be programmed with a database of common questions and answers related to the use of the robot and AI concepts. It would use machine learning to continuously learn from new queries and improve its responses over time. This feature could be accessed via a mobile app or a web interface, which connects to the robot via WiFi or Bluetooth. The development of this feature would require expertise in AI and NLP, and would likely involve the use of existing AI frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
