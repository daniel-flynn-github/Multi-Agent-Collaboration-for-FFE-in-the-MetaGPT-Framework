Idea: AI Concept Demonstrator
Idea Description: To address the pain point of limited understanding of AI concepts, an AI Concept Demonstrator can be developed. This feature would use the robot's sensors and movement capabilities to demonstrate key AI concepts in a practical, hands-on way. For example, the robot could use its camera to recognize objects or faces, demonstrating computer vision. The robot could also use its movement capabilities to navigate a maze, demonstrating pathfinding algorithms. These demonstrations could be pre-programmed into the robot, or they could be developed by teachers or students using a simple programming interface. The development of this feature would require expertise in AI and robotics, and would likely involve the use of existing AI and robotics frameworks.
