Idea: Collapsible Design
Idea Description: Design the cat walking device with a collapsible feature that enables it to fold down into a compact size for easy storage and transportation. The collapsible design should not compromise the device's structural integrity or comfort for the cat. Implement a locking mechanism that securely holds the device in its extended position during use and allows for quick folding when not in use. Utilize high-quality hinges and materials that can withstand frequent folding and unfolding without wear and tear.
