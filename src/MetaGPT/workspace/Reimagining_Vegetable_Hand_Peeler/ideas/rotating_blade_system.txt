Idea: Rotating Blade System
Idea Description: Introduce a rotating blade system in the vegetable hand peeler to prevent frequent clogging during peeling. The blades can be designed to rotate in a circular motion as they come in contact with the vegetable, reducing the likelihood of getting stuck. This continuous movement helps to maintain a consistent peeling action without the need for manual adjustments. The rotating blade system will enhance efficiency, especially when peeling larger or irregularly shaped vegetables.
