Journey Map: 
Emily starts her day by packing her walking backpack with snacks, water, and a few toys for her toddler. They head to the local park where they spend the morning walking and exploring. Emily's backpack proves handy for carrying all their necessities. After a picnic lunch, they continue their walk, with Emily occasionally carrying her tired toddler. They return home in the afternoon, both tired but happy.
