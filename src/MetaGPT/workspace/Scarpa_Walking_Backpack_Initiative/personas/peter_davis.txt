Journey Map: 
Peter starts his day with a long walk in the countryside. He packs his walking backpack with essentials - water, snacks, a map, and a first-aid kit. He enjoys the peace and tranquility, his backpack comfortably carrying his gear. He stops for a break in the afternoon, unpacking his backpack for a small picnic. He returns home by evening, feeling refreshed and content with his day.
