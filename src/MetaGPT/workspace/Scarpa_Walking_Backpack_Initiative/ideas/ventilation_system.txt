Idea: Ventilation System
Idea Description: To further enhance comfort during long use, a ventilation system can be added to the backpack. This system could include a mesh back panel that allows air to circulate, reducing sweat and discomfort. The ventilation system would be designed to be lightweight and durable, using materials such as breathable nylon mesh. This design would not only improve comfort but also the backpack's performance in different weather conditions, making it a versatile choice for various outdoor activities.
