Idea: Ergonomic Padding and Straps
Idea Description: To address the discomfort experienced after long use, ergonomic padding and straps can be incorporated into the backpack's design. The padding would be made from breathable, lightweight materials that conform to the user's body, reducing pressure points and improving comfort. The straps would be adjustable, allowing users to customize the fit based on their body shape and size. Additionally, a waist strap could be added to distribute the weight evenly across the body, reducing strain on the shoulders and back. This design would enhance the backpack's comfort, making it suitable for long walks.
