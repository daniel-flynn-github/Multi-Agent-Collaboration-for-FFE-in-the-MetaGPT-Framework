Idea: Expandable Backpack Design
Idea Description: To address the issue of space, an expandable backpack design can be implemented. This design would allow users to increase the backpack's capacity when needed, providing extra space for toddler's toys and other items. The expandability could be achieved through the use of zippers or adjustable straps that can loosen or tighten the backpack's volume. The expandable sections would be made from lightweight, durable, and eco-friendly materials, ensuring the backpack remains light and sustainable. This design would enhance the backpack's capacity without compromising its weight or comfort.
