Idea: Modular Compartment System
Idea Description: To address the lack of compartmentalization, a modular compartment system can be introduced. This system would allow users to customize the backpack's interior based on their needs. It would include removable dividers and pouches that can be attached or detached using Velcro or zippers. This would allow for the creation of a dedicated space for toddler's toys, a separate compartment for food and water, and other essentials. The modular system would be designed to be lightweight and durable, using materials such as ripstop nylon. This system would not only increase the backpack's functionality but also its versatility, catering to different users' needs.
PRODUCTIVITY:
    Reasoning: The modular compartment system could potentially increase production complexity due to the need for additional components, but it could also streamline production by standardizing these components.
