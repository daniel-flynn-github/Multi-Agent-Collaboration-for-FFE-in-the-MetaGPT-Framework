Idea: Solar-Powered Hydration System
Idea Description: Incorporate a solar panel into the backpack's design to power a built-in hydration system. The system includes a hydration bladder with a tube for easy access to water while on the move. The solar panel charges a battery that powers a small pump for convenient water flow. This feature aligns with the 'Hydration and Snack Accessibility' principle, ensuring users have easy access to hydration without the need for external power sources. The technical implementation involves selecting efficient solar panels, a compact pump, and a rechargeable battery with a low self-discharge rate for optimal performance.
