Idea: Modular Storage Pods
Idea Description: Introduce modular storage pods that can be attached or detached from the main backpack to customize storage space based on the user's needs. Each pod serves a specific purpose, such as a first aid kit pod, a snack pod, or a tech gear pod. This feature aligns with the 'Organization and Accessibility' principle, offering users flexibility in organizing their essentials and ensuring easy access to specific items without rummaging through the entire backpack. The technical implementation involves designing standardized attachment points for the pods, ensuring secure connections, and optimizing pod shapes for efficient storage.
