Idea: Biometric Security Lock
Idea Description: Integrate a biometric fingerprint scanner as a security measure for the backpack, allowing only authorized users to access its contents. The scanner can be linked to a locking mechanism that secures the main compartments, providing peace of mind for users leaving their backpack unattended. This feature aligns with the 'Safety and Security' principle, enhancing the protection of valuable items or personal belongings stored in the backpack. The technical implementation involves selecting a reliable fingerprint scanner module, integrating it with a locking mechanism, and ensuring seamless operation with minimal power consumption.
