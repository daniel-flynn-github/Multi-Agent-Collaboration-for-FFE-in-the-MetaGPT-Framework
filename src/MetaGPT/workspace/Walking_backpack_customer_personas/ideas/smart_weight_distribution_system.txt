Idea: Smart Weight Distribution System
Idea Description: Integrate sensors and actuators into the backpack straps and frame to dynamically adjust weight distribution based on the user's movements and posture. The system will use AI algorithms to analyze the load distribution and automatically shift weight to reduce strain on the user's back and shoulders. This feature aligns with the 'Weight Distribution and Load Management' principle, enhancing comfort and reducing the risk of injuries during long walks. The technical implementation involves embedding pressure sensors in the straps and a microcontroller to control the actuators for real-time adjustments.
