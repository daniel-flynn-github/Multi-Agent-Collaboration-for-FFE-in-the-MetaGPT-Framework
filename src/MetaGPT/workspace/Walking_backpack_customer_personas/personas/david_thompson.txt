Journey Map: 
David starts his day with a morning walk in the park, carrying his walking backpack with a book and a thermos of tea. He stops to admire the scenery and takes breaks on benches along the way. In the afternoon, he attends a nature photography class and uses his backpack to carry his camera equipment and notebook for taking notes.
