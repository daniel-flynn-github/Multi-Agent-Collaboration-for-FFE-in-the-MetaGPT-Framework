Journey Map: 
Elena wakes up early to join a group hike and packs her walking backpack with a reusable water bottle and trail mix. During the hike, she uses the backpack's compartments to organize her gear and easily access her camera for nature shots. After the hike, she collects any trash she finds on the trail and stores it in her backpack to dispose of properly.
