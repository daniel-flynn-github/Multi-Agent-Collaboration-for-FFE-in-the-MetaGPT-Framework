Journey Map: 
Alex prepares his walking backpack the night before a family camping trip. The next morning, he loads it with snacks, water, and extra clothes for the kids. During the hike, he uses the backpack to carry his children's essentials and finds a spot for a picnic. Back at the campsite, he unpacks the backpack to set up a cozy outdoor dinner for the family.
