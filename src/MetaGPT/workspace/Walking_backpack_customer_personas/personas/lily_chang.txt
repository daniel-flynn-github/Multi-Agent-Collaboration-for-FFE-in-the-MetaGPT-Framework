Journey Map: 
Lily packs her walking backpack with a sketchbook and pencils for an outdoor drawing session. She heads to a nearby botanical garden and finds a quiet spot to sketch flowers and trees. During a break, she uses the backpack to store her snacks and water. After her drawing session, she walks back to campus with her backpack filled with nature-inspired sketches.
