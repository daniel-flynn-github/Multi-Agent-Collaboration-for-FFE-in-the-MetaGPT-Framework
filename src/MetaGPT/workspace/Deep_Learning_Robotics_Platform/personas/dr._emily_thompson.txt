Journey Map: 
Dr. Emily Thompson starts her day by checking the progress of her deep learning models on the robotic platform. She appreciates the platform's reliability and scalability, which allows her to train multiple models simultaneously. She uses the platform's advanced features to fine-tune her models, but sometimes she finds the interface a bit complex. She spends a significant amount of time troubleshooting and wishes there were more detailed documentation or support available.
