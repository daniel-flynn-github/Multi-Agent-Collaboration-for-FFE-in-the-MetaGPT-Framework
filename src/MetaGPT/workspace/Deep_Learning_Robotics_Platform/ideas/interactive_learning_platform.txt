Idea: Interactive Learning Platform
Idea Description: To address the pain point of 'Lack of detailed tutorials', we can develop an interactive learning platform. This platform would feature step-by-step video tutorials, interactive 3D models of the robotic arm, and real-time coding examples. Users can follow along with the tutorials, manipulate the 3D models to understand the robot's mechanics better, and see the effects of their code in real-time. This platform can be developed using existing web technologies like WebGL for 3D rendering and Python for the backend. The tutorials can be created in collaboration with our existing users and experts in the field.
