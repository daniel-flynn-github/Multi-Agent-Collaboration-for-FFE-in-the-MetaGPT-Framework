Idea: Comprehensive Documentation
Idea Description: To address the 'Insufficient documentation' pain point, we can create comprehensive documentation that covers all aspects of our product. This would include technical specifications, user manuals, API references, troubleshooting guides, and best practices. The documentation can be made available online for easy access and can be developed using existing documentation tools like Sphinx for Python.
