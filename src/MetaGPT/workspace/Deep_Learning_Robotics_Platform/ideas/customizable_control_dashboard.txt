Idea: Customizable Control Dashboard
Idea Description: Another solution to the 'Complex interface' pain point is to develop a customizable control dashboard. This dashboard would allow users to add, remove, and rearrange control elements according to their needs and preferences. This would make the interface more adaptable and user-friendly. The dashboard can be developed using existing web technologies and libraries like React and D3.js.
