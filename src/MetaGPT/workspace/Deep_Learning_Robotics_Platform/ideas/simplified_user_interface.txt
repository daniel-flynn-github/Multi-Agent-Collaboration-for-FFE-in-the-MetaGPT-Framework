Idea: Simplified User Interface
Idea Description: To address the 'Complex interface' pain point, we can redesign the user interface of our software to be more intuitive and user-friendly. We can use principles of human-computer interaction and user experience design to ensure that the interface is easy to navigate and understand. We can also include features like drag-and-drop programming, visual data flow diagrams, and real-time feedback to make the interface more engaging and less intimidating for users. This can be achieved using existing UI/UX design tools and frameworks.
