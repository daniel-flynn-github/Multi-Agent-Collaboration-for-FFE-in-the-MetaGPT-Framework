Idea: Terrain Sensing Insoles
Idea Description: Develop a smart insole that can sense the type of terrain and provide feedback to the user. The insole will have sensors that can detect the hardness and texture of the surface. It will then send this information to a mobile app that will provide the climber with information about the terrain and suggest the best climbing techniques. This will help the climbers transitioning from indoor to outdoor climbing by giving them real-time information about the outdoor terrain.
