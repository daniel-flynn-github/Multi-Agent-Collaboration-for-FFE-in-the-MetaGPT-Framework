Idea: Adaptive Grip Technology
Idea Description: Introduce an Adaptive Grip Technology in the Veloce climbing shoe. This technology will allow the shoe to adjust its grip based on the terrain. For indoor climbing, the grip will be softer to prevent damage to the indoor climbing walls. For outdoor climbing, the grip will be harder to provide better traction on natural surfaces. This will help the climbers transitioning from indoor to outdoor climbing by providing them with the right amount of grip for each terrain.
