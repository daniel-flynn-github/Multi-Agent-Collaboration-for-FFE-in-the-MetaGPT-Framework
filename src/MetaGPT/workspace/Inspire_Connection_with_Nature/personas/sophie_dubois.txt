Journey Map: 
After a long day at work, Sophie heads to a local park for a leisurely walk. She carries her lightweight walking backpack with essentials like a book, sunscreen, and a small picnic. Sophie enjoys the comfort of the padded straps and breathable back panel as she strolls through the greenery. She stops to admire blooming flowers and takes a moment to relax on a bench, feeling content and rejuvenated.
