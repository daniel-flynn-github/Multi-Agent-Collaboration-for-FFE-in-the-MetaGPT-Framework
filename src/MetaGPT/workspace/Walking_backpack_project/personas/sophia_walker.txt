Journey Map: 
Sophia wakes up early on a Saturday morning, excited for her day hike. She packs her lightweight walking backpack with essentials like water, snacks, a map, and her camera. Heading to the trailhead, she enjoys the peaceful surroundings and the sound of birds chirping. During the hike, Sophia stops to take photos of wildflowers and scenic views. She uses her backpack to carry her belongings comfortably and appreciates its ergonomic design. After a few hours of hiking, Sophia finds a serene spot for a picnic lunch. She unpacks her food from the backpack and relaxes in nature. As the sun starts to set, Sophia heads back, feeling accomplished and rejuvenated from her outdoor adventure.
