Idea: Progress Tracking Dashboard
Idea Description: To address the difficulty in evaluating students' progress, we propose a progress tracking dashboard. This dashboard would track students' progress in the learning module and challenges, providing teachers and lecturers with a clear overview of each student's understanding and skills. The dashboard could include metrics such as completed modules, challenge success rate, and improvement over time. The dashboard would be accessible via the app, and data would be stored and processed using a cloud-based server. This feature would be developed using Python for backend processing and a JavaScript framework such as React for the frontend.
