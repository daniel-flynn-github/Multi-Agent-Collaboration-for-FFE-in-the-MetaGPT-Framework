Idea: Customizable AI Challenge
Idea Description: Another approach to explaining complex AI concepts is through a customizable AI challenge. Teachers and lecturers could set up a challenge, such as navigating a maze or recognizing objects, and students would program the robot to complete the challenge using AI techniques. This would provide a hands-on learning experience, allowing students to apply the concepts they learn. The challenges could be set up and controlled via the same app as the learning module. The robot's movement capabilities, camera, and sensors would be used to complete the challenges. This feature would be developed using Python and TensorFlow, and the robot's existing hardware.
