Idea: Accessible Water Bottle Holder
Idea Description: Revamp the water bottle holder design to provide convenient and easy access, addressing the inconvenience of the current setup. Implement a side-mounted water bottle pocket with an elastic closure system for quick and secure access. Integrate an insulated sleeve to maintain the temperature of the drink. Include a drainage system at the bottom of the pocket to prevent water accumulation. The technical implementation would involve redesigning the backpack's side panel, incorporating elastic bands for bottle retention, and selecting durable and insulating materials for the sleeve.
