Idea: Smart Weight Distribution System
Idea Description: Develop a smart weight distribution system within the walking backpack to alleviate pressure on the shoulders and back, addressing discomfort. Utilize sensors strategically placed within the backpack to monitor weight distribution in real-time. Incorporate an electronic control unit that automatically adjusts strap tension and weight balance based on the user's movements. This system would ensure that the load is evenly distributed, reducing strain on specific areas. The technical implementation would involve integrating sensors, actuators, and a microcontroller within the backpack, along with a user interface for customization and monitoring.
