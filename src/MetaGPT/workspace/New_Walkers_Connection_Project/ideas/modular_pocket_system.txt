Idea: Modular Pocket System
Idea Description: Implement a modular pocket system within the walking backpack to offer customizable storage solutions and address the need for easy-to-reach pockets. Design detachable pockets that can be repositioned or removed based on the user's preference. Utilize a hook-and-loop attachment system for quick and secure pocket placement. Include various sizes and types of pockets for versatility in organizing gear. The technical implementation would involve developing a modular attachment mechanism, selecting durable materials for the pockets, and ensuring compatibility with the backpack's design.
