Idea: Retractable Water Bottle Holder
Idea Description: Introduce a retractable water bottle holder mechanism to enhance accessibility and reduce interference with other items in the backpack. Design a retractable arm with a secure locking mechanism that extends outward for easy bottle access and retracts to keep a low profile when not in use. Utilize a spring-loaded system for smooth operation and durability. Incorporate a self-draining feature to prevent moisture buildup. The technical implementation would involve engineering a retractable arm mechanism, selecting robust materials for longevity, and conducting extensive testing for reliability.
