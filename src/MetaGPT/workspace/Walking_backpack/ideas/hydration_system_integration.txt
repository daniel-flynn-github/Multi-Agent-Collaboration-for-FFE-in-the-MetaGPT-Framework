Idea: Hydration System Integration
Idea Description: Integrate a hydration system into the backpack to eliminate the need for a separate water bottle pocket. Include a hydration bladder compartment with a tube routing system for convenient access to water while on the move. Design the compartment with insulation to regulate water temperature and prevent leakage. Incorporate a hands-free bite valve for easy hydration during walks. Ensure compatibility with popular hydration bladder brands for user convenience.
