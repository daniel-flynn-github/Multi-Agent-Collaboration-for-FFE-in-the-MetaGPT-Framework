Idea: Anti-Chafing Coating
Idea Description: Implement a specialized anti-chafing coating on the straps to prevent irritation during long hikes. This coating can be a silicone-based material that reduces friction and minimizes the risk of chafing. The coating should be durable, lightweight, and skin-friendly to ensure long-lasting comfort. Conduct thorough testing to validate the effectiveness of the coating under various environmental conditions.
