Idea: Expandable Water Bottle Pocket
Idea Description: Enhance the water bottle pocket size by incorporating an expandable design. Utilize stretchable materials that allow the pocket to accommodate different bottle sizes securely. Implement a drawstring or elastic closure system to adjust the pocket size based on the user's needs. Ensure the pocket is easily accessible while maintaining the backpack's overall sleek design. Conduct stress tests to validate the pocket's durability and secure bottle retention.
