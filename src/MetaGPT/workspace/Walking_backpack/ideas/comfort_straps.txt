Idea: Comfort Straps
Idea Description: Introduce padded straps with moisture-wicking material to address strap chafing on long hikes. The padding will provide cushioning and reduce friction, while the moisture-wicking fabric will keep the user dry and comfortable. Additionally, incorporate adjustable straps to customize the fit for individual users. Utilize advanced textiles like breathable mesh and memory foam for optimal comfort and durability.
