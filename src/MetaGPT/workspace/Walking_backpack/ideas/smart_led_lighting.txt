Idea: Smart LED Lighting
Idea Description: Incorporate smart LED lighting strips into the backpack for enhanced visibility and style. Integrate rechargeable LED lights along the seams or straps to increase visibility during low-light conditions. Include customizable lighting modes such as steady, flashing, and color-changing options. Implement a user-friendly control system to adjust the lighting settings easily. Ensure the LED lights are energy-efficient and waterproof to withstand outdoor use.
