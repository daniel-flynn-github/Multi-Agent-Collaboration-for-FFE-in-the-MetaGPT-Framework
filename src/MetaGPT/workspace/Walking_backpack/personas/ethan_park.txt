Journey Map: 
Ethan starts his outdoor workout with his lightweight walking backpack, packed with essentials like resistance bands, a water bottle, and a towel. The backpack's adjustable straps and breathable mesh panels allow Ethan to move freely and stay cool during his trail run. As he transitions to strength training exercises, Ethan uses the backpack's multiple compartments to access his gear easily. When he finishes his workout, Ethan appreciates the backpack's moisture-wicking fabric that keeps his belongings dry and odor-free. He heads home feeling satisfied with his outdoor fitness session supported by his functional walking backpack.
