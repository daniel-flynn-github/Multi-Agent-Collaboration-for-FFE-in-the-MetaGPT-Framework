Journey Map: 
Sophia starts her day by packing her walking backpack with essentials like water, snacks, a map, and a first aid kit. She adjusts the straps for a comfortable fit and sets off on a local trail. As she hikes, Sophia appreciates the padded shoulder straps and breathable back panel of the backpack, which keep her comfortable and cool. When she encounters a steep incline, Sophia uses the adjustable waist belt for added support and stability. After a few hours of hiking, Sophia takes a break and enjoys the convenient access to her water bottle and snacks in the backpack's side pockets. She continues her hike feeling energized and supported by her walking backpack.
