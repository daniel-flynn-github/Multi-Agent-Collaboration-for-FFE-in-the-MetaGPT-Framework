Idea: Auto-Peel
Idea Description: Auto-Peel is a hands-free vegetable peeler that uses a small, rechargeable battery to power a rotating blade. The user simply inserts the vegetable into the device and presses a button to start the peeling process. The device is equipped with a sensor that can detect the thickness of the vegetable skin and adjust the peeling speed and depth accordingly, ensuring that only the skin is removed and the vegetable flesh is preserved. This addresses the pain point of peeling being time-consuming as it allows the user to do other tasks while the vegetable is being peeled. The device is also designed with a safety lock feature that automatically shuts off the device if it detects an object other than a vegetable, such as a finger, to prevent accidents.
