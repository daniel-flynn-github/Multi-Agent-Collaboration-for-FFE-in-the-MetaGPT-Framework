Idea: Precision Peeler
Idea Description: Precision Peeler is a vegetable peeler designed with an adjustable blade that allows the user to control the thickness of the peels. The blade is made of high-quality stainless steel that ensures a sharp and precise cut. The peeler also has a built-in scale that measures the weight of the vegetable before and after peeling, allowing the user to know exactly how much vegetable is being peeled. This addresses the pain point of the traditional peeler being slow and imprecise.
