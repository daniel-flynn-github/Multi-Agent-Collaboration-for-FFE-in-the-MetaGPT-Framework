Idea: Peel and Collect
Idea Description: Peel and Collect is a vegetable peeler designed with a built-in container to collect the peels. The peeler is designed in a way that the peels are directed into the container as the vegetable is being peeled, reducing the mess on the countertop. The container is detachable and can be easily emptied and cleaned. This addresses the pain point of peeling being messy and time-consuming as it eliminates the need to clean up the peels after peeling.
