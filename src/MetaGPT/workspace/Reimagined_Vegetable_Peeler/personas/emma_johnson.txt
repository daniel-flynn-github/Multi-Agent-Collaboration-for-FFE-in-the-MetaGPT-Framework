Journey Map: 
Emma starts her day by preparing lunch for her family. She decides to make a vegetable salad and begins peeling the vegetables. As she juggles between her toddler and the peeling task, she worries about the sharp peeler causing an accident. The process also takes longer than she'd like, causing her to rush through the rest of the meal prep.
