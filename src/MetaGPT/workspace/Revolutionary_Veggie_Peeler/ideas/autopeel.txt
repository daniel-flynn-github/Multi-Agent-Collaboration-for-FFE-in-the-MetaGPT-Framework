Idea: AutoPeel
Idea Description: AutoPeel is a hands-free vegetable peeler designed to address the time-consuming nature of vegetable peeling. It uses an adjustable clamp to hold the vegetable in place and a motorized peeler that moves up and down the vegetable, peeling it in seconds. The peeler is equipped with a sensor that detects the thickness of the peel, ensuring it only removes the necessary amount. It is powered by a rechargeable battery, making it portable and cordless. The peeler is also designed with a safety lock that prevents the blade from moving when it's not in use, reducing the risk of accidents. The peeler is made from durable, recyclable materials, making it eco-friendly and suitable for outdoor use.
