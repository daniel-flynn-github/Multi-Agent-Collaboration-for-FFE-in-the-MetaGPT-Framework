Journey Map: 
Emily comes home from her job and starts cooking dinner. She peels carrots for a salad, struggling to find a place for the peeler in her small kitchen. She then peels potatoes for a side dish, finding the process time-consuming and wishing she could save time. After dinner, she cleans the peeler, finding it difficult to clean and store in her limited space.
