Journey Map: 
John starts his camping trip by preparing a meal over the campfire. He peels potatoes for a stew, finding it difficult to peel vegetables outdoors. Later, he peels apples for a dessert, being extra careful not to cut himself with the sharp peeler. At the end of the day, he cleans the peeler, finding it difficult to clean without running water.
