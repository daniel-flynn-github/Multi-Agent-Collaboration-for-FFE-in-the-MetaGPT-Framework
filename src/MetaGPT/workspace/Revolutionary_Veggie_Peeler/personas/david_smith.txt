Journey Map: 
David comes home from work and starts preparing for a dinner party. He peels potatoes for a gourmet dish, finding the task tedious and wishing he could focus on more complex parts of the recipe. He peels apples for a dessert, being extra careful not to cut himself with the peeler. After the party, he cleans up, finding the peeler difficult to clean.
