Journey Map: 
Laura starts her day by preparing a vegan breakfast. She peels carrots for a juice, finding it challenging to peel the hard vegetable with a traditional peeler. Later, she prepares dinner, peeling potatoes for a vegan dish. She worries about the environmental impact of disposing her old peeler. After dinner, she cleans the peeler, wishing it was more eco-friendly.
