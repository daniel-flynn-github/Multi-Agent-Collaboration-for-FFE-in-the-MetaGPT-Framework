Journey Map: 
Sarah starts her day by preparing breakfast for her family. She peels carrots for a fresh juice, finding the process messy and time-consuming. Later, she prepares lunch, peeling potatoes for a hearty stew. She's interrupted by her kids, and worries about them getting too close to the sharp peeler. In the evening, she peels apples for a pie, finding the process tiring after a long day.
