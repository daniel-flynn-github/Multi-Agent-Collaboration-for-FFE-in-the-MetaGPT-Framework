Idea: Feedback Collection System
Idea Description: To address the pain point of time-consuming feedback collection and analysis, the robot can be equipped with a feedback collection system. This system will allow the robot to collect feedback from the students during the lessons. The feedback can be in the form of answers to questions, reactions to the lessons, or direct inputs from the students. This can be achieved by integrating NLP algorithms and sentiment analysis into the robot's system. The collected feedback can be analyzed and used to improve the effectiveness of the robot as a learning tool.
