Idea: AI Tutor Mode
Idea Description: To address the pain point of difficulty in preparing lesson plans involving AI robot, the robot can be equipped with an 'AI Tutor Mode'. This mode will come with pre-programmed lesson plans that align with the curriculum. The robot will guide the students through the lesson, explaining the AI concepts in a simple, understandable manner. This can be achieved by integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms into the robot's system. The robot will use its camera and sensors to interact with the students and provide a hands-on learning experience. The lesson plans can be updated and customized via a wireless link with a computer.
