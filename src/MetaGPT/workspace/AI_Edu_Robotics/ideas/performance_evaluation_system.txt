Idea: Performance Evaluation System
Idea Description: Another solution to the pain point of time-consuming feedback collection is to have the robot evaluate the students' performance based on their interaction with it. The robot can track the students' progress, identify areas of improvement, and provide personalized feedback. This can be achieved by using the robot's sensors and AI algorithms to monitor the students' actions and responses. The evaluation results can be sent to the teachers via a wireless link with a computer.
