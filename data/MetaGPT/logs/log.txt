Role: Your role in the team is to use your knowledge base to analyse a collection of issues and synthesise three fundamental needs. While a fundamental need does not need at assist with every issue in the collection, it should aim to capture the essence of as many as possible.Try to be analytical and profound, and go into detail. 
Requirements: According to the context and using the needs created within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters.
##Fundamental needs: Provided as a Python List[str]. A fundamental need should be unique and specific, not a vague encapsulating phrase. A fundamental need should also be a singular need, not a list of needs. A need should be a single sentence. Don't try to suggest a product. Make sure a fundamental need isn't an initiative, but rather a problem that needs a solution.
##Reasoning: Explain the reasoning behind each fundamental need, provided as a Python List[str] (where each list element is the reasoning behind a corresponding need)

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. For each product, you have to analyse four features, describe how feasible they are in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,Tuple[str,float]]], a list of dictionaries of feasabilities and scores for each product.

Role: Your role in the team is to use your knowledge base to analyse a collection of issues and synthesise three fundamental needs. While a fundamental need does not need at assist with every issue in the collection, it should aim to capture the essence of as many as possible.Try to be analytical and profound, and go into detail. 
Requirements: According to the context and using the needs created within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters.
##Fundamental needs: Provided as a Python List[str]. A fundamental need should be unique and specific, not a vague encapsulating phrase. A fundamental need should also be a singular need, not a list of needs. A need should be a single sentence. Don't try to suggest a product. Make sure a fundamental need isn't an initiative, but rather a problem that needs a solution.
##Reasoning: Explain the reasoning behind each fundamental need, provided as a Python List[str] (where each list element is the reasoning behind a corresponding need)

Role: Your role in the team is to use your knowledge base to analyse a collection of issues and synthesise three fundamental needs. While a fundamental need does not need at assist with every issue in the collection, it should aim to capture the essence of as many as possible.Try to be analytical and profound, and go into detail. 
Requirements: According to the context and using the needs created within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters.
##Fundamental needs: Provided as a Python List[str]. A fundamental need should be unique and specific, not a vague encapsulating phrase. A fundamental need should also be a singular need, not a list of needs. A need should be a single sentence. Don't try to suggest a product. Make sure a fundamental need isn't an initiative, but rather a problem that needs a solution.
##Reasoning: Explain the reasoning behind each fundamental need, provided as a Python List[str] (where each list element is the reasoning behind a corresponding need)

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. For each product, you have to analyse four features, describe how feasible they are in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,Tuple[str,float]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key, and the corresponding value is a tuple, containing a float score for that feature and a string explanation for that score. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters.
##Fundamental needs: Provided as a Python List[str]. A fundamental need should be unique and specific, not a vague encapsulating phrase. A fundamental need should also be a singular need, not a list of needs. A need should be a single sentence. Don't try to suggest a product.

For each product, you have to analyse four features, describe how feasible they are in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,Tuple[str,float]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a float value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. For each product, you have to analyse four features, describe how feasible they are in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,Tuple[str,float]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a float value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. For each product, you have to analyse four features, describe how feasible they are in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,Tuple[str,float]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a float value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. For each product, you have to analyse four features, describe how feasible they are in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also. Make sure the reasoning and score for each product is different. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurances and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad, infact critical thinking is essential for this to rule out bad ideas. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,Tuple[str,float]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a float value) for that feature.

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. For each product, you have to analyse four features, describe how feasible they are in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also. Make sure the reasoning and score for each product is different. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurances and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad, infact critical thinking is essential for this to rule out bad ideas. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit your response to 1500 tokens or less

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,Tuple[str,float]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a float value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also. Make sure the reasoning and score for each product and feature is different. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to one sentence. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,Tuple[str,float]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a float value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also. Make sure the reasoning and score for each product and feature is different. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don\'t say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don\'t be scared to be critical if an idea is bad.

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to one sentence. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,Tuple[str,float]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a float value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also.. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad.

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also.. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to one sentence. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,Tuple[str,float]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a float value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also.. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don\'t say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don\'t be scared to be critical if an idea is bad.

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also.. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,Tuple[str,float]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a float value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also.. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also.. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

output a properly formatted JSON, wrapped inside [CONTENT][/CONTENT] like format example,

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also.. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

Role: Your role is to analyse how well a product could perform on the market for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the how well the product could perform on the market for all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. For each product, you have to analyse four features, describe how feasible they are in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is best and 0 is worst): 1) Potential Market Size: How much of the market will the product be able to capture given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project, and your knowledge of the market. 2) Potential Attractive Returns: What are the potential returns from creating this product and selling it, and how good are they? 3) Protectable Advantage: What advantages does this product have over similair competing products in the market, and how protectable are they? 4) Likelihood of disruptive impact: Is the product likely to be able to either disrupt pre-existing markets or create a new one? Finally give a fifth feature, which is overall market viability that summarises the market viability based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Market Viability: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list of dictionaries of features and their scores for each product.

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also.. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also.. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also.. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don\'t say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don\'t be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.\n\n##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly.

Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature.

Role: Your role is to analyse how well a product could perform on the market for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the how well the product could perform on the market for all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. For each product, you have to analyse four features, describe how feasible they are in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is best and 0 is worst): 1) Potential Market Size: How much of the market will the product be able to capture given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project, and your knowledge of the market. 2) Potential Attractive Returns: What are the potential returns from creating this product and selling it, and how good are they? 3) Protectable Advantage: What advantages does this product have over similair competing products in the market, and how protectable are they? 4) Likelihood of disruptive impact: Is the product likely to be able to either disrupt pre-existing markets or create a new one? Finally give a fifth feature, which is overall market viability that summarises the market viability based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. The score next to product name is just a placeholder: it should always be 0 and do not include it in your average calculations. LIMIT YOURR RESPONSE TO 1500 TOKENS

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Market Viability: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list of dictionaries of features and their scores for each product.

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also.. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

Role: Your role is to analyse how well a product could perform on the market for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the how well the product could perform on the market for all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. For each product, you have to analyse four features, describe how feasible they are in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is best and 0 is worst): 1) Potential Market Size: How much of the market will the product be able to capture given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project, and your knowledge of the market. 2) Potential Attractive Returns: What are the potential returns from creating this product and selling it, and how good are they? 3) Protectable Advantage: What advantages does this product have over similair competing products in the market, and how protectable are they? 4) Likelihood of disruptive impact: Is the product likely to be able to either disrupt pre-existing markets or create a new one? Finally give a fifth feature, which is overall market viability that summarises the market viability based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. The score next to product name is just a placeholder: it should always be 0 and do not include it in your average calculations. LIMIT YOURR RESPONSE TO 1500 TOKENS

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also.. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also.. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.
##Ranked pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str,List[int]], the key is the pain point, the value is a list of integers where the first entry is the impact score, and the second entry is the difficulty score.

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.
##Ranked pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str,List[int]], the key is the pain point, the value is a list of string integers where the first entry is the impact score, and the second entry is the difficulty score.

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100. A high score should mean larger impact, and highly difficult for the two metrics respectively.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.

He has been climbing for a few years and is now looking to invest in a pair of high-quality climbing shoes to improve his performance.",

He also wants to make sure the shoes fit well and provide the necessary support for his climbing style.",
            "Frustrations": "Alex is frustrated with his current climbing shoes as they are starting to wear out and no longer provide the grip he needs. He has tried a few different brands in the past but hasn't found the perfect fit yet. He also finds it difficult to navigate through the wide range of climbing shoe options available in the market.",
            "Journey Map": "1. Research: Alex starts by researching different climbing shoe brands and models online. He reads reviews, watches videos, and seeks recommendations from fellow climbers.
2. Store visit: Alex visits a local climbing gear store to try on different climbing shoes. He talks to the store staff to get their expert advice on finding the right fit and suitable shoes for his climbing style.
3. Comparison: Alex compares the features, prices, and customer reviews of the different climbing shoes he tried on. He takes into consideration factors such as shoe comfort, durability, and performance.

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100. A high score should mean larger impact, and highly difficult for the two metrics respectively.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.
##Ranked pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str,List[int]], the key is the pain point, the value is a list of integers where the first entry is the impact score, and the second entry is the difficulty score.

Role: Your role in the team is to use your knowledge base to analyse a collection of issues and synthesise three fundamental needs. While a fundamental need does not need at assist with every issue in the collection, it should aim to capture the essence of as many as possible.Try to be analytical and profound, and go into detail. 
Requirements: According to the context and using the needs created within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters.
##Fundamental needs: Provided as a Python List[str]. A fundamental need should be unique and specific, not a vague encapsulating phrase. A fundamental need should also be a singular need, not a list of needs. A need should be a single sentence. Don't try to suggest a product. Make sure a fundamental need isn't an initiative, but rather a problem that needs a solution.
##Reasoning: Explain the reasoning behind each fundamental need, provided as a Python List[str] (where each list element is the reasoning behind a corresponding need)

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100. A high score should mean larger impact, and highly difficult for the two metrics respectively.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.
##Ranked pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str,List[int]], the key is the pain point, the value is a list of integers where the first entry is the impact score, and the second entry is the difficulty score.

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100. A high score should mean larger impact, and highly difficult for the two metrics respectively.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.
##Ranked pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str,List[int]], the key is the pain point, the value is a list of integers where the first entry is the impact score, and the second entry is the difficulty score.

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100. A high score should mean larger impact, and highly difficult for the two metrics respectively.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.
##Ranked pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str,List[int]], the key is the pain point, the value is a list of integers where the first entry is the impact score, and the second entry is the difficulty score.

Role: Your role in the team is to use your knowledge base to analyse a collection of issues and synthesise three fundamental needs. While a fundamental need does not need at assist with every issue in the collection, it should aim to capture the essence of as many as possible.Try to be analytical and profound, and go into detail. 
Requirements: According to the context and using the needs created within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters.
##Fundamental needs: Provided as a Python List[str]. A fundamental need should be unique and specific, not a vague encapsulating phrase. A fundamental need should also be a singular need, not a list of needs. A need should be a single sentence. Don't try to suggest a product. Make sure a fundamental need isn't an initiative, but rather a problem that needs a solution.
##Reasoning: Explain the reasoning behind each fundamental need, provided as a Python List[str] (where each list element is the reasoning behind a corresponding need)

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100. A high score should mean larger impact, and highly difficult for the two metrics respectively.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.
##Ranked pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str,List[int]], the key is the pain point, the value is a list of integers where the first entry is the impact score, and the second entry is the difficulty score.

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100. A high score should mean larger impact, and highly difficult for the two metrics respectively.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.
##Ranked pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str,List[int]], the key is the pain point, the value is a list of integers where the first entry is the impact score, and the second entry is the difficulty score.

Role: Your role in the team is to use your knowledge base to analyse a collection of issues and synthesise three fundamental needs. While a fundamental need does not need at assist with every issue in the collection, it should aim to capture the essence of as many as possible.Try to be analytical and profound, and go into detail. 
Requirements: According to the context and using the needs created within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters.
##Fundamental needs: Provided as a Python List[str]. A fundamental need should be unique and specific, not a vague encapsulating phrase. A fundamental need should also be a singular need, not a list of needs. A need should be a single sentence. Don't try to suggest a product. Make sure a fundamental need isn't an initiative, but rather a problem that needs a solution.
##Reasoning: Explain the reasoning behind each fundamental need, provided as a Python List[str] (where each list element is the reasoning behind a corresponding need)

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100. A high score should mean larger impact, and highly difficult for the two metrics respectively.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.
##Ranked pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str,List[int]], the key is the pain point, the value is a list of integers where the first entry is the impact score, and the second entry is the difficulty score.

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100. A high score should mean larger impact, and highly difficult for the two metrics respectively.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.
##Ranked pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str,List[int]], the key is the pain point, the value is a list of integers where the first entry is the impact score, and the second entry is the difficulty score.

output a properly formatted JSON, wrapped inside [CONTENT][/CONTENT] like format example,

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100. A high score should mean larger impact, and highly difficult for the two metrics respectively.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.

Role: Your role in the team is to use your knowledge base to analyse a collection of issues and synthesise three fundamental needs. While a fundamental need does not need at assist with every issue in the collection, it should aim to capture the essence of as many as possible.Try to be analytical and profound, and go into detail. 
Requirements: According to the context and using the needs created within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters.
##Fundamental needs: Provided as a Python List[str]. A fundamental need should be unique and specific, not a vague encapsulating phrase. A fundamental need should also be a singular need, not a list of needs. A need should be a single sentence. Don't try to suggest a product. Make sure a fundamental need isn't an initiative, but rather a problem that needs a solution.
##Reasoning: Explain the reasoning behind each fundamental need, provided as a Python List[str] (where each list element is the reasoning behind a corresponding need)

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100. A high score should mean larger impact, and highly difficult for the two metrics respectively.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100. A high score should mean larger impact, and highly difficult for the two metrics respectively.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.
##Ranked pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str,List[int]], the key is the pain point, the value is a list of integers where the first entry is the impact score, and the second entry is the difficulty score.

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also.. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also.. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don\'t say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don\'t be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.\n\n##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly.

For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also.. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don\'t say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don\'t be scared to be critical if an idea is bad.

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100. A high score should mean larger impact, and highly difficult for the two metrics respectively.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.
##Ranked pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str,List[int]], the key is the pain point, the value is a list of integers where the first entry is the impact score, and the second entry is the difficulty score.

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also.. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also.. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don\'t say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don\'t be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.\n\n##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly.

THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company? Finally give a fifth feature, which is an overall feasability that summarises the feasibility based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also.. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don\'t say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don\'t be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.\n\n##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly.

Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature.

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100. A high score should mean larger impact, and highly difficult for the two metrics respectively.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.
##Ranked pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str,List[int]], the key is the pain point, the value is a list of integers where the first entry is the impact score, and the second entry is the difficulty score.

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company?. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

Role: Your role is to analyse how well a product could perform on the market for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the how well the product could perform on the market for all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. For each product, you have to analyse four features, describe how feasible they are in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is best and 0 is worst): 1) Potential Market Size: How much of the market will the product be able to capture given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project, and your knowledge of the market. 2) Potential Attractive Returns: What are the potential returns from creating this product and selling it, and how good are they? 3) Protectable Advantage: What advantages does this product have over similair competing products in the market, and how protectable are they? 4) Likelihood of disruptive impact: Is the product likely to be able to either disrupt pre-existing markets or create a new one? Finally give a fifth feature, which is overall market viability that summarises the market viability based on the four assessed features, give a score for this also. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. The score next to product name is just a placeholder: it should always be 0 and do not include it in your average calculations. LIMIT YOURR RESPONSE TO 1500 TOKENS

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Market Viability: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list of dictionaries of features and their scores for each product.

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100. A high score should mean larger impact, and highly difficult for the two metrics respectively.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.
##Ranked pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str,List[int]], the key is the pain point, the value is a list of integers where the first entry is the impact score, and the second entry is the difficulty score.

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company?. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company?. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100. A high score should mean larger impact, and highly difficult for the two metrics respectively.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.
##Ranked pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str,List[int]], the key is the pain point, the value is a list of integers where the first entry is the impact score, and the second entry is the difficulty score.

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100. A high score should mean larger impact, and highly difficult for the two metrics respectively.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.
##Ranked pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str,List[int]], the key is the pain point, the value is a list of integers where the first entry is the impact score, and the second entry is the difficulty score.

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company?. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

Role: Your role is to analyse how well a product could perform on the market for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the how well the product could perform on the market for all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. For each product, you have to analyse four features, describe how feasible they are in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is best and 0 is worst): 1) Potential Market Size: How much of the market will the product be able to capture given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project, and your knowledge of the market. 2) Potential Attractive Returns: What are the potential returns from creating this product and selling it, and how good are they? 3) Protectable Advantage: What advantages does this product have over similair competing products in the market, and how protectable are they? 4) Likelihood of disruptive impact: Is the product likely to be able to either disrupt pre-existing markets or create a new one? Fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. The score next to product name is just a placeholder: it should always be 0 and do not include it in your average calculations. LIMIT YOURR RESPONSE TO 1500 TOKENS

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Market Viability: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list of dictionaries of features and their scores for each product.

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100. A high score should mean larger impact, and highly difficult for the two metrics respectively.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.
##Ranked pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str,List[int]], the key is the pain point, the value is a list of integers where the first entry is the impact score, and the second entry is the difficulty score.

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company?. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100. A high score should mean larger impact, and highly difficult for the two metrics respectively.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company?. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company?. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

Role: Your role is to analyse how well a product could perform on the market for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the how well the product could perform on the market for all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. For each product, you have to analyse four features, describe how feasible they are in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is best and 0 is worst): 1) Potential Market Size: How much of the market will the product be able to capture given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project, and your knowledge of the market. 2) Potential Attractive Returns: What are the potential returns from creating this product and selling it, and how good are they? 3) Protectable Advantage: What advantages does this product have over similair competing products in the market, and how protectable are they? 4) Likelihood of disruptive impact: Is the product likely to be able to either disrupt pre-existing markets or create a new one? Fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. The score next to product name is just a placeholder: it should always be 0 and do not include it in your average calculations. LIMIT YOURR RESPONSE TO 1500 TOKENS

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Market Viability: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list of dictionaries of features and their scores for each product.

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100. A high score should mean larger impact, and highly difficult for the two metrics respectively.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.
##Ranked pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str,List[int]], the key is the pain point, the value is a list of integers where the first entry is the impact score, and the second entry is the difficulty score.

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company?. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

Role: Your role is to analyse how well a product could perform on the market for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the how well the product could perform on the market for all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. For each product, you have to analyse four features, describe how feasible they are in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is best and 0 is worst): 1) Potential Market Size: How much of the market will the product be able to capture given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project, and your knowledge of the market. 2) Potential Attractive Returns: What are the potential returns from creating this product and selling it, and how good are they? 3) Protectable Advantage: What advantages does this product have over similair competing products in the market, and how protectable are they? 4) Likelihood of disruptive impact: Is the product likely to be able to either disrupt pre-existing markets or create a new one? Fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. The score next to product name is just a placeholder: it should always be 0 and do not include it in your average calculations. LIMIT YOURR RESPONSE TO 1500 TOKENS

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Market Viability: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list of dictionaries of features and their scores for each product.

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100. A high score should mean larger impact, and highly difficult for the two metrics respectively.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.
##Ranked pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str,List[int]], the key is the pain point, the value is a list of integers where the first entry is the impact score, and the second entry is the difficulty score.

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company?. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

Role: Your role is to analyse how well a product could perform on the market for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the how well the product could perform on the market for all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. For each product, you have to analyse four features, describe how feasible they are in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is best and 0 is worst): 1) Potential Market Size: How much of the market will the product be able to capture given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project, and your knowledge of the market. 2) Potential Attractive Returns: What are the potential returns from creating this product and selling it, and how good are they? 3) Protectable Advantage: What advantages does this product have over similair competing products in the market, and how protectable are they? 4) Likelihood of disruptive impact: Is the product likely to be able to either disrupt pre-existing markets or create a new one? Fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. The score next to product name is just a placeholder: it should always be 0 and do not include it in your average calculations. LIMIT YOURR RESPONSE TO 1500 TOKENS

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Market Viability: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list of dictionaries of features and their scores for each product.

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100. A high score should mean larger impact, and highly difficult for the two metrics respectively.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.
##Ranked pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str,List[int]], the key is the pain point, the value is a list of integers where the first entry is the impact score, and the second entry is the difficulty score.

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company?. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

Role: Your role is to analyse how well a product could perform on the market for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the how well the product could perform on the market for all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. For each product, you have to analyse four features, describe how feasible they are in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is best and 0 is worst): 1) Potential Market Size: How much of the market will the product be able to capture given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project, and your knowledge of the market. 2) Potential Attractive Returns: What are the potential returns from creating this product and selling it, and how good are they? 3) Protectable Advantage: What advantages does this product have over similair competing products in the market, and how protectable are they? 4) Likelihood of disruptive impact: Is the product likely to be able to either disrupt pre-existing markets or create a new one? Fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. The score next to product name is just a placeholder: it should always be 0 and do not include it in your average calculations. LIMIT YOURR RESPONSE TO 1500 TOKENS

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Market Viability: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list of dictionaries of features and their scores for each product.

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100. A high score should mean larger impact, and highly difficult for the two metrics respectively.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.
##Ranked pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str,List[int]], the key is the pain point, the value is a list of integers where the first entry is the impact score, and the second entry is the difficulty score.

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company?. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

Role: Your role is to analyse how well a product could perform on the market for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the how well the product could perform on the market for all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. For each product, you have to analyse four features, describe how feasible they are in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is best and 0 is worst): 1) Potential Market Size: How much of the market will the product be able to capture given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project, and your knowledge of the market. 2) Potential Attractive Returns: What are the potential returns from creating this product and selling it, and how good are they? 3) Protectable Advantage: What advantages does this product have over similair competing products in the market, and how protectable are they? 4) Likelihood of disruptive impact: Is the product likely to be able to either disrupt pre-existing markets or create a new one? Fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. The score next to product name is just a placeholder: it should always be 0 and do not include it in your average calculations. LIMIT YOURR RESPONSE TO 1500 TOKENS

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Market Viability: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list of dictionaries of features and their scores for each product.

Role: Your role is to analyse product journey maps of individuals and come up with issues they are likely to experience specific to them. Try to keep the pain point to a maximium of four words long. Once you have created each pain point point, rank each pain point on two metrics: impact (how common is the pain point?) and difficulty (how hard to fix is it likely to be). Each metric should be an integer score out of 100. A high score should mean larger impact, and highly difficult for the two metrics respectively.
Requirements: According to the context and using the already created personas within it, fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Persona specfic pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str, List[str]], the key is persona name, and the value is alist of persona issues. Create 7 pain points for each persona.
##Ranked pain points: Provided as Python Dict[str,List[int]], the key is the pain point, the value is a list of integers where the first entry is the impact score, and the second entry is the difficulty score.

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company?. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

Role: Your role is to analyse the feasability of a product for a company, using both the context you are given and any context you know from your own knowledge base.
Requirements: Analyse the feasability of all the products in the context with as much critical thought as possible. THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company?. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don't say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don't be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.

##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don't add any characters
##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO

THE SCORES AND REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PRODUCT. For each product, you have to analyse four features; describe how feasible each product is in terms of each feature, and give the feature a score out of 100 (where 100 is most feasible and 0 is least feasable): 1) Research and Development: How feasible is it that the product can be researched and developed given the resources the company would have, the budget for the whole project, and the timeframe for the whole project. 2) Go to Market: How effectively will the company be able to establish the product in the market, given the companies resources, the budget for the project, and the timeframe for the project. 3) Required Partners: Are lots of partners necessary, and if so how feasible is it that the company will be able to work with them given the company, budget, and timeframe. 4) Compatibility: How compatible is the product with the company?. Make sure reasoning is insightfull. Don\'t say further research may be necessary, act with assurance and make assumptions. Rely on your knowledge as much as possible. Don\'t be scared to be critical if an idea is bad. Limit the reasoning to two sentences. fill in the following missing information, each section name is a key in json ,If the requirements are unclear, ensure minimum viability and avoid excessive design. Limit the reasoning to one sentence.\n\n##Project name: Repeat the project name from the context exactly. Dont change anything and don\'t add any characters\n##Feasibility: Provided as Python List[Dict[str,List[str]]], a list where each element corresponds to each product. Each element should contain be a dictionary, where each feature is a key and the corresponding value is a tuple. The tuple should contain first a string analysis of the feasibility of the product in terms of that feature, and then a score out of 100 (a str value) for that feature. NOTE -> The score for the product name is a placeholder and SHOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO\nPartners\noutput a properly formatted JSON, wrapped inside [CONTENT][/CONTENT] like format example,\nand only output the json inside this tag, nothing else\n'}]
