Product: GripMaster Chalk
Product Description: GripMaster Chalk is a specially formulated climbing chalk that enhances grip on slippery surfaces. This chalk contains a unique blend of magnesium carbonate and a proprietary friction-enhancing compound. The combination of these ingredients creates a chalk that not only absorbs moisture but also increases friction between the hand and the surface. The GripMaster Chalk comes in a compact and resealable pouch, making it easy to carry in a backpack. It is the perfect accessory for climbers transitioning from indoor gyms to outdoor climbing, providing them with the extra grip they need to tackle slippery surfaces.
