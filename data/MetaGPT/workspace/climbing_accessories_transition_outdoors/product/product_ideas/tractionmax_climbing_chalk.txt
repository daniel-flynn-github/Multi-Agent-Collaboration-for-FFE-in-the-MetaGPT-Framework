Product: TractionMax Climbing Chalk
Product Description: TractionMax Climbing Chalk is a specially formulated chalk that addresses the lack of grip on slippery surfaces. This chalk contains a unique blend of high-friction agents that enhance grip and reduce slippage. The chalk particles adhere to the skin, creating a dry and tacky surface that improves friction between the hands and the climbing holds. TractionMax Climbing Chalk is long-lasting and provides consistent grip throughout the climbing session. It is conveniently packaged in a compact and resealable container, making it easy to carry in a backpack. With TractionMax Climbing Chalk, climbers can maintain a secure grip on outdoor routes, even in challenging conditions.
