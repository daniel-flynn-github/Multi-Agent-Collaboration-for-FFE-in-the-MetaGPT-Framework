Collected Data:

Data collected for Phase 1 of Evaluation':
 - 'scenario_1_pdf' -> Collected using a Qualtrics Survey
 - 'scenario_2_pdf' -> Collected using a Qualtrics Survey

Data collected for Phase 2 of Evaluation:
 - All data for this section was collected using and on a paper survey sheet. The sheets have been stored safely but at this time of writing this readme I'm in a different country and not able to access them. All of them can be produced if required

Data collected for Phase 3 of Evaluation:
 - 'Edubot_29 March 2024_10.43'-> Collected using a Qualtrics Survey
 - 'Portabread 2_29 March 2024_16.04.xlsx' - > Collected using a Qualtrics Survey
Data from Phase 3 was processed and visualised using Excel. This was done because Excel was the most effective graphing software in terms of native support for the the required radar plots.
